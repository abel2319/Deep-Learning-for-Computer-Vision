# 📸 Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision (WQU)

This repository contains all of my work and learning progress through the **Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision** program offered by [WorldQuant University](https://www.wqu.edu/).

> 🧠 The lab is a hands-on, project-based program that focuses on real-world applications of deep learning in computer vision. Over ~10–16 weeks, I completed a series of end-to-end projects using tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and more.
